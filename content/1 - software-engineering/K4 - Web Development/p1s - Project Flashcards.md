- Copy Me Repository: Randomnly shows you either a capture on an actual  
- Use me repository:a template repository that is to be resetted after each challenge


Design of the UI Challenge

Overall Ideas
- This has to be cross platforms including:
	- Front end Development
	- It should be able 


A challenge has to contain the following:
- A description with image or interactive component e.g. built on react
- The actual code of the snippet done in that code/language
- The link to the sample repo/base repo to start the project with.


Roadmap

Prototyping this idea:
1. I am thinking on a simple website with the links towards the documentation of each challange link .e.g it can be a notion link, etc. and the default details on a database
	1. The idea is to have also a demo link if possible, in the future this is to be embedeed, a codepen tool could work as well.
2. And a simple tracker in term of completion and success rate of each. 
3. This first protoype should be an actual webpage for students to practice things and upload.

Project Files Organization:

- Static Project Randomizer
	- Takes in a json and randomizes within the js

```json
{
  collection: {
  "module_id": {
	  module_name:
	  module_id:
	  challenges: {
		  challenge_id: {
			  project_description_url: ....
			  project_
		  }
	  }
  }
  }
}
```
