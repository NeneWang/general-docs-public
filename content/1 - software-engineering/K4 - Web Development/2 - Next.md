 ### Naming Structures

### Folder Structure

#### Folder Naming and Dynamic Routes

Validity of `[[...sign-in]]`

Yes, a folder named `[[...sign-in]]` is **valid** in Next.js. Here’s how it works:

- `[[...sign-in]]` defines a **catch-all optional parameter** for the `sign-in` route. It can match various URL segments, and if there’s no extra segment, it will match just `/sign-in`.

#### Parenthesis
(clerk)

here folders are wrapped in parentheses to signify certain groupings or layouts. This is different from the dynamic or catch-all routing.


In the new **`app` directory** structure introduced with Next.js 13, you can use **parentheses** to organize **layout groups**. These groupings are not intended for routing parameters but for layouts that can be shared across different routes.

For example, a folder structure like:


## Clerk and Authorization

```js
"use client"

import { useAuth, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
const ProtectedPage = () => {
const {} = useAuth();


return (

<div>
	<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
	<h1>Protected Page</h1>
	<p>This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.</p>
	<p>You can add your protected content here.</p>
	<p>If you are not authenticated, you will be redirected to the sign-in page.</p>
</div>
)
}

export default ProtectedPage;
```
